systems using control loops. It can range from a single home heating controller using
a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large Industrial control systems which are used
for controlling processes or machines. A control system is a system, which provides the desired
response by controlling the output. </p>

                  Accuracy: Accuracy is the measurement tolerance of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.

Accuracy can be improved by using feedback elements. To increase the accuracy of any control system error detector should be present in the control system.

That means the heating element produces heat as long as the power supply is kept on and the final room temperature does not have any control over the input power supply of the system. This system is referred to as an open-loop control system.</p>

                  Stability: It is an important characteristic of the control system. For the bounded input signal, the output must be bounded and if the input is zero then the output must be zero then such a control system is said to be a stable system.

Bandwidth: An operating frequency range decides the bandwidth of the control system. Bandwidth should be as large as possible for the frequency response of a good control system.

This change can be expressed in terms of sensitivity. Any control system should be insensitive to such parameters but sensitive to input signals only.</p>

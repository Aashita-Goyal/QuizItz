Definition: Reduction in cost per unit resulting from increased production, realized
through operational efficiencies. Economies of scale can be accomplished because as
production increases, the cost of producing each additional unit falls

Strain gage is one of the most popular types of transducer. It has got a wide range of
applications. It can be used for measurement of force, torque, pressure, acceleration and many
other parameters. The basic principle of operation of a strain gage is simple: when strain is
applied to a thin metallic wire, its dimension changes.

                  Semiconductor type Strain Gage
Semiconductor type strain gage is made of a thin wire of silicon, typically 0.005 inch to 0.0005
inch, and length 0.05 inch to 0.5 inch. They can be of two types: p-type and n-type. In the former
the resistance increases with positive strain, while, in the later the resistance decreases with
temperature.

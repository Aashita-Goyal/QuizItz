                  Power diodes
Power diodes are made of silicon p-n junction with two terminals, anode and cathode. P-N junction is
formed by alloying, diffusion and epitaxial growth. Modern techniques in diffusion and epitaxial
processes permit desired device characteristics. The diodes have the following advantages High
mechanical and thermal reliability High peak inverse voltage Low reverse current Low forward
voltage drop High efficiency Compactness.

                  Power transistors
Power transistors are devices that have controlled turn-on and turn-off characteristics. These devices
are used a switching devices and are operated in the saturation region resulting in low on-state voltage
drop. They are turned on when a current signal is given to base or control terminal. The transistor
remains on so long as the control signal is present.

                The turn OFF process of an SCR is called commutation. The term commutation means the transfer of
currents from one path to another. So the commutation circuit does this job by reducing the forward
current to zero so as to turn OFF the SCR or Thyristor.

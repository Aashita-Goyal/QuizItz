                  (1) Fixed Automation:-
It is the automation in which the sequence of processing or assembly operations to be carried
out is fixed by the equipment configuration. In fixed automation, the sequence of operations
(which are simple) are integrated in a piece of equipment. Therefore, it is difficult to
automate changes in the design of the product.

                  (2) Programmable Automation:-
It is the automation in which the equipment is designed to accommodate various product
configurations in order to change the sequence of operations or assembly operations by
means of control program. Different types of programs can be loaded into the equipment to
produce products with new configurations (i.e., new products).

A computer integrated manufacturing system which is an extension of programmable
automation is referred as flexible automation. It is developed to minimize the time loss

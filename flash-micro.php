                  Conductance
There will be a leakage current between the transmission line and the ground, and also
between the phase conductors. This small amount of leakage current generally flows
through the surface of the insulator. Inverse of this leakage current is termed as
Conductance. It is denoted by ‚ÄúG‚Äù.

the ratio of the amplitudes of voltage and current along that line, which has no reflections,
is called as Characteristic impedance.
